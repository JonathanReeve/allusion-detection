{{Ancient Greek religion}}

The following is a list of [[gods]], [[goddesses]] and many other divine and semi-divine figures from Ancient [[Greek mythology]] and [[Ancient Greek religion]]. (The list does not include creatures; for these, see ''[[List of Greek mythological creatures]]''.)

==Immortals==
The Greeks created images of their deities for many purposes. A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or multiple deities, and might be decorated with [[relief]] scenes depicting myths. Divine images were common on coins. Drinking cups and other [[ancient Greek pottery|vessels]] were painted with scenes from Greek myths.

===Major gods and goddesses===

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:NAMA Aphrodite Syracuse.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Aphrodite]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀφροδίτη}}, ''Aphroditē'')

Goddess of beauty, love, desire, and pleasure. Although married to [[Hephaestus]] she had many lovers, most notably [[Ares]], [[Adonis]], and [[Anchises]]. She was depicted as an extraordinarily beautiful woman, with poets praising the radiance of her smile in particular. Her symbols include roses and other flowers, the [[scallop]] shell, and the [[Myrtus communis|myrtle]] wreath. Her sacred animals include doves and sparrows. Her Roman counterpart is [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Apollo, lira, dan angsa.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Apollo]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, ''Apóllōn'')

God of music, arts, knowledge, healing, plague, prophecy, poetry, manly beauty, and archery. He is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]]. Both Apollo and Artemis use a bow and arrow. Apollo is often incorrectly identified as the god of the sun. Although Apollo is the god of the sun in Roman mythology, Helios is the god of the sun in Greek mythology. In sculpture, Apollo is depicted as a very handsome, beardless young man with long hair and an ideal physique. As the embodiment of perfectionism, he could be cruel and destructive, and his love affairs were rarely happy. He often appears in the company of the Muses. His attributes include the [[laurel wreath]] and [[lyre]]. His sacred animals include [[roe deer]], swans, cicadas, hawks, ravens, crows, foxes, mice, and snakes. His Roman counterpart is also named Apollo.
|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Ares Canope Villa Adriana b.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Ares]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἄρης}}, ''Árēs'')

God of war, bloodshed, and violence. The son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]], he was depicted as a beardless youth, either nude with a helmet and spear or sword, or as an armed warrior. [[Homer]] portrays him as moody and unreliable, and he generally represents the chaos of war in contrast to Athena, a goddess of military strategy and skill. Ares is known for cuckolding his brother Hephaestus and conducting an affair with Aphrodite. His sacred animals include vultures, venomous snakes, dogs, and boars. His Roman counterpart [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] by contrast was regarded as the dignified ancestor of the Roman people.

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Diane de Versailles Leochares.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Artemis]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἄρτεμις}}, ''Ártemis'')

Virgin goddess of the hunt, wilderness, animals, young girls, childbirth, and plague. She is often incorrectly identified as the goddess of the moon, but that is in fact [[Selene]]. In later times Artemis became associated with bows and arrows. She is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and twin sister of [[Apollo]]. In art she is often depicted as a young woman dressed in a short knee-length [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]] and equipped with a hunting bow and a quiver of arrows. Her attributes include hunting spears, animal pelts, [[deer]] and other wild animals. Her sacred animals include deer, bears, and wild boars. Her Roman counterpart is [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:7348 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Athena - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|160px]]
|''' [[Athena]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnâ'')

Goddess of intelligence, skill, peace, warfare, battle strategy, handicrafts, and wisdom. According to most traditions, she was born from Zeus's head, fully formed and armored. She is depicted as being crowned with a crested helm, armed with shield and spear, and wearing the [[aegis]] over a long dress. Poets describe her as "grey-eyed" or having especially bright, keen eyes. She is a special patron of [[Greek hero|heroes]] such as [[Odysseus]]. She is also the patron of the city Athens (which was named after her). Her symbol is the [[olive]] tree. She is commonly shown as being accompanied by her sacred animal, the owl. Her Roman counterpart is [[Minerva]].

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Eleusinian hydria Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.46 n2.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Demeter]]''' ({{lang|grc|Δημήτηρ}}, ''Dēmētēr'')

Goddess of grain, agriculture, harvest, growth, and nourishment. Demeter is a daughter of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and a sister of [[Zeus]], by whom she bore [[Persephone]]. Demeter is one of the main deities of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], in which her power over the life cycle of plants symbolizes the passage of the human soul through life and into the afterlife. She is depicted as a mature woman, often crowned and holding sheafs of [[wheat]] and a torch. Her symbols are the [[cornucopia]], wheat-ears, the winged serpent, and the lotus staff. Her sacred animals include pigs and snakes. Her Roman counterpart is [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]].

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Dionysos Louvre Ma87 n2.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Dionysus]]''' ({{lang|grc|Διόνυσος}}, ''Diónysos'')/'''Bacchus''' ({{lang|grc|Βάκχος}}, ''Bákkhos'')

God of wine, parties, festivals, madness, chaos, drunkenness, drugs, and ecstasy. In art he is depicted as either an older bearded god or an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]], long-haired youth. His attributes include the [[thyrsus]], a drinking cup, the grape vine, and a crown of [[ivy]]. He is often in the company of his [[thiasos]], a group of attendants including [[satyr]]s, [[maenad]]s, and his old tutor [[Silenus]]. The consort of Dionysus was [[Ariadne]]. His sacred animals include dolphins, serpents, tigers, and donkeys. A later addition to the Olympians, in some accounts he replaced Hestia. Bacchus was another name for him in Greek, and came into common usage among the Romans.

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Hades-et-Cerberus-III.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Hades]]''' ({{lang|grc|ᾍδης}}, ''Hádēs'')/'''[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]''' ({{lang|grc|Πλούτων}}, ''Ploutōn'')

King of the underworld and the dead. His consort is [[Persephone]]. His attributes are the [[drinking horn]] or [[cornucopia]], key, sceptre, and the three-headed dog [[Cerberus]]. His sacred animals include the screech owl. He was one of three sons of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and thus sovereign over one of the three realms of the universe, the underworld. As a [[chthonic]] god, however, his place among the Olympians is ambiguous. In the [[mystery religions]] and Athenian literature, Pluto ("the Rich") was his preferred name, with ''Hades'' referring to the underworld itself. The Romans translated ''Plouton'' as [[Dis Pater]] ("the Rich Father") or Pluto.

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Vulcan Coustou Louvre MR1814.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Hephaestus]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἥφαιστος}}, ''Hḗphaistos'')

God of fire, metalworking, and crafts. Either the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] or Hera alone, he is the smith of the gods and the husband of the adulterous [[Aphrodite]]. He was usually depicted as a bearded, crippled man with hammer, tongs, and anvil, and sometimes riding a donkey. His sacred animals include the donkey, the guard dog, and the crane. Among his creations was the armor of [[Achilles]]. Hephaestus used the fire of the forge as a creative force, but his Roman counterpart [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] was feared for his destructive potential and associated with the [[volcanism|volcanic power]] of the earth.

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Hera Campana Louvre Ma2283.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Hera]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἥρα}}, ''Hḗra'')

Queen of the gods, and goddess of marriage, women, childbirth, heirs, kings, and empires. She is the wife and sister of [[Zeus]], and the daughter of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. She was usually depicted as a regal woman in the prime of her life, wearing a diadem and veil and holding a lotus-tipped staff. Although she is the goddess of marriage, Zeus's many infidelities drive her to jealousy and vengefulness. Her sacred animals include the heifer, the peacock, and the cuckoo. Her Roman counterpart is [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]].

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Hermes Ingenui Pio-Clementino Inv544.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Hermes]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἑρμῆς}}, ''Hērmēs'')

God of boundaries, travel, communication, trade, language, and writing. The son of [[Zeus]] and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], Hermes is the messenger of the gods, and a [[psychopomp]] who leads the souls of the dead into the afterlife. He was depicted either as a handsome and athletic beardless youth, or as an older bearded man. His attributes include the herald's wand or [[caduceus]], winged sandals, and a traveler's cap. His sacred animals include the tortoise.
|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:Hestia - Wellesley College - DSC09634.JPG|160px]]
|'''[[Hestia]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ἑστία}}, ''Hestía'')

Virgin goddess of the hearth, home, and chastity. She is a daughter of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Cronus]], and a sister of [[Zeus]]. Not often identifiable in Greek art, she appeared as a modestly veiled woman. Her symbols are the hearth and kettle. In some accounts, she gave up her seat as one of the [[Twelve Olympians]] in favor of [[Dionysus]], and she plays little role in Greek myths. Her Roman counterpart [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], however, was a major deity of the Roman state.

|-
| width="200px" align="center" | [[File:0035MAN Poseidon.jpg|160px]]
|'''[[Poseidon]]''' ({{lang|grc|Ποσειδῶν}}, ''Poseidōn'')

God of the sea, rivers, floods, droughts, and earthquakes. He is a son of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and the brother of [[Zeus]] and [[Hades]]. He rules one of the three realms of the universe, as king of the sea and the waters. In art he is depicted as a mature man of sturdy build, often with a luxuriant beard, and holding a [[trident]]. His sacred animals include the horse and the dolphin. His wedding with [[Amphitrite]] is often presented as a [[Thiasos#Other thiasoi|triumphal procession]]. In some stories he rapes Medusa, leading to her transformation into a hideous Gorgon and also to the birth of their two children, Pegasus and Chrysaor. His Roman counterpart is [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]].
